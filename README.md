# BIO_350_F25

starting our BIO_350 assignments repo.

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- Making a difference equation
- Technical difficulties, SHOULD be better from now on
- It works!

IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
- Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckweed covers a pond
- Minimal technical difficulties, bit better
- Works and introduced matplotlib, and plotting on x and y axes

IC Example 1: 
- plotted the log of the Duckweed population data

IC Assignment 3: Chapter 3 of Ecology Handbook
- Did some independent class work
- Had some difficulties with printing results, but Prof. E helped
- displayed logistic equation on a graph
- We followed the example in Chapter 3 of the Ecology Handbook that involved plants in a 2m x 2m plot

IC Example 2: Population Data
- Used Population Data csv
- Imported pandas
- plotted data
- added a carrying capacity line, adjusted the color, and added gridlines using Copilot assistance

IC Assignment 4: Chapter 4 of Ecology Handbook
- competition models
- Lotka-Volterra Competition Model- standard competition model between two different species

IC Example 3: Competition Models
- for i in time
- added "if" statements
- playing around with adding pertubations
- algebraic equation from Introduction to Quantitative Ecology
- adjusted carrying capacities to see if the two species can coexist/be stable

IC Assignment 5: Chapter 5 of Ecology Handbook
- SIR (Susceptable, Infected, Removed) Model
- worked independently
- used comments/Copilot to help generate code
- set parameters using the problem in the Handbook
- ran the SIR model for t=30 days
