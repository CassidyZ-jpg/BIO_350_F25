    "      \"description\": \"Amplicon sequencing targets specific amplicon sequences for analysis. Whole genome sequencing reads the entire DNA strand. Amplicon sequencing allows for more targeted analysis of specific genes or mutations, while whole genome sequencing allows for an understanding of the complete DNA sequence.\"\n",

    "      \"description\": \"DNA barcoding is a method for identifying species using a short DNA sequence from a specific gene. This sequence acts as a 'fingerprint,' and it is kept in a digital library of DNA barcodes used to identify organisms. DNA barcodes are procured through collecting samples, putting them through PCR, and sequencing the DNA.\"\n",

Richness is the count of different species in an area, while evenness measures how evenly the species are distributed. Beta diversity measures the differences in species composition between two or more communities.\"\n",

Data normalization is the process of organizing data into tables and/or relationships to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. Data extrapolation is used to make predict values or trends beyond the existing dataset. Data normalization can be used during early stages of data processing to improve data quality.\"\n",

Lags are created by shifting a time series forward or backward in time. This method analyzes the relationship between past and current data points to identify patterns and correlations over time.\"\n",

    "      \"description\": \"Linear mixed effect models are statistical tools that extends linear regression to handle grouped or hierarchical data by including both fixed and random effects. Fixed effects represent the average relationship across all groups, while random effects account for variability between groups. Linear mixed effect models capture dependencies between groups and provides a more nuanced understanding of the data than a simple linear model.\"\n",

It uses a power law relationship (for example, Y=aM^b). Allometric scale models can be used to estimate a drug's behavior on humans based on animal data.\"\n",

Non-linear regression uses a non-linear equation to find the best-fit curve of a dataset. The relationship between the dependent variable and the parameters is inherently nonlinear.\"\n",
